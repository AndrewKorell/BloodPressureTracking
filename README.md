# Blood Pressure Tracking

The purpose here is to create a full stack implementation of a blood pressure tracker. I am aming for Django and Go as two different versions of the back-end.. Maui for mobile, and mostly likely Angular as a web front-end.

We also need the ability to cache data locally. 

# Operational theory 

There is a USER and a PATIENT 

The USER has access to all the patients and can add and read their records.

A USER would have to create themselves as a patient if they want to enter their own measurements.

# Features 

1. Allow user to create an account.
2. Record DateTime, Systolic Pressure, Diastolic Pressure, Pulse and a Note 
3. Evaluate if the current reading is Normal, Elevated, or State1 or Stage2 of hypertension 
4. Display data in chart and table form 
5. Create a report to share over email 
6. Manage stored data
7. Access data by mobile or webbrowswer
8. Notify User that blood pressure needs to be checked 
9. Ask user to check both arms on first check, and keep as reference 

# Screens 

- Login
- Signup
- Log Blood Pressure
- Show History as Table / Chart

# Setup 

Location of backend. 

# Models

## User (this is created by Django) 

- ID (PK, Unqiue, AutoIncrement)
- Access Level
- Email
- username 

## UserToPatient 

- ID (PK, Unique, AutoIncrement)
- user_id
- parient_id

Need a table that can limit Patients to a particular USER

Patients should be shared between users.  

The creator of the patient will have to share patients with other users. 

## Patient 

- ID (PK, Unique, AutoIncrement)
- user_id (FK, who created this user)
- PatientName Char(50) NOT_NULL Unique *Note3
- First Name Char(50)
- Last Name Char(50)
- Email Char(50)

*Note3: This will be autogenerated. Most likely <FirstName><LastName><number>
This will be expanded on.  

## Measurment 

- ID (PK, Unique, AutoIncrement)
- patient_id (FK, to patient table)
- evaluation_id (Reference to static table)
- Systolic NOT_NULL uint8   
- Diastolic NOT_ NULL uint8
- Pulse NOT_NULL uint8
- Weight NOT_NULL uint8  NULLABLE *Note2  
- MeasurementDateTime DateTime NOT_NULL *Note1
- EntryDateTime DateTime NOT_NULL *Note1 
- Note Text NULLABLE 

*Note1: Two datetime because measurements may be taken offline, and I also like keeping track of updates to a database
*Note2: Weight is good to have, but we shouldn't force the operator to find a scale everytime they measure blood pressure  

## Evaluation (for adults)

0 - Top Below 120 and Bottom Below 80 -> Normal  (Green) 

1 - Top 120 to 129 and Bottom Below 80 -> Elevated (Orange)

2 - Top 130 to 139 or Bottom 80-89 State 1  -> Hyper Tension (Orange Red)

3 - Top over 140 or Bottom 90 or higher -> Stage 2 Hyper Tension (Red)

*Make a note that the rangs are lower for children and teenagers. 
This might be a useful configuration option, but we're trying to keep this simple. 

# Background 

I will let the Mayo clinic deal with the details.
